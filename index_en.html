                        <h3>Background</h3>
                        <p>In recent years, Web services have become deeply integrated into our lives, and the construction of composite services by combining multiple Web services has become common for the purpose of improving development efficiency and creating new value.
                            However, selecting services that meet the objectives from the vast number of Web services provided worldwide and combining them appropriately is extremely difficult with conventional manual work and human-dependent approaches.
                            Furthermore, there are limitations to human judgment alone when considering service selection and combination that take into account interoperability and compatibility between services, QoS (Quality of
                            Service), security, and reliability, as well as other non-functional requirements.
                            Therefore, to efficiently and optimally construct composite services, technology that automatically supports service discovery, selection, and combination is necessary.

                        <h3>Recommendation by Multi-Agent</h3>
                        <p>In this research, we use a multi-agent system to recommend Web services.
                            In conventional service composition, users had to describe their objectives and requirements using formal logical expressions (temporal logic or predicate logic). This was a very difficult problem for users and a barrier to service composition.
                            Therefore, we believed that by using a large language model (LLM) that can be described in natural language, users would be able to easily describe their requirements.
                            However, in service composition by a single agent, the range of target services is extensive, so an LLM based on general knowledge tends to have a shallow understanding of specialized knowledge, and there is a problem of insufficient information regarding service technical specifications and execution environments. Although this problem can be partially improved by adding specialized knowledge to the prompt, as the number and complexity of services increase, new problems arise: prompt inflation and, as a result, character limits.
                            In this research, to solve these problems, we introduce a multi-agent system composed of multiple LLM agents. By specializing each agent in a specific domain, we aim to alleviate prompt constraints and achieve more accurate service recommendations.
